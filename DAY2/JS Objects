An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions â€” which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.) Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

For example: A person object can be defines as:
const Person ={
      name:'ABC',
      age:100,
      gender:'Male'
}

The object properties can be accessed using dot notation. For example console.log(Person.age) logs 100.
