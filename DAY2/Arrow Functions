An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.

Code example:

const materials = [
  'Hydrogen',
  'Helium',
  'Lithium',
  'Beryllium'
];

console.log(materials.map(material => material.length));



Expected Output: Array [8, 6, 7, 9]
